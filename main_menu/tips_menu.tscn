WASD and the arrow keys are general movement
Dash with SPACE, you dash in the direction of your current movement
Aim with your mouse if your technique does not have an auto aim modifier, in which case it will aim at the nearest enemy.
Toggling
You can toggle your techniques by pressing the number it is associated with
Which is the order in which you attined the technique
It starts at 0, so your first gun can be toggled by pressing 0, and so on
Same as enemies deal damage to you by touching you, it is vice versa. 
Staging Up
Every 10 levels you Stage Up, and multiply all your stats, this rewards specialization, but mid stage gameplay punishes it. Experiment see how much you can get away with.
Bump Damage
Due to the damage its best to do this to weak slow mobs at the edge of the pack.
Unlinke all other cooldowns the cooldown for the dash never increases or decreases
The duration of a status good or bad is equal to half the cooldown of the technique. 
Negative Scaling
All costs and negative effects scale in level except for cooldown and wait_time, so while a technique leveling might increase its damage it will also increase its cost.
Additionally not investing in a damage stat consistently will eventually result in you hitting like pillows against their hp.
Cooldown Limit
The game process's attempts to shoot your gun using physics, and thus it has a hard cap equal to the physics tick
Leaving The Game
You can leave the game and return to the main menu by pressing \"esc\"
Stats
Strength
Increases melee damage to a major degree, Health and Pierce
Pierce is how much your damage ignore defense, at a 1:3 ratio
So if your opponent has 30 defense and you have 30 strength you can ignore 10 of their defense.
Grace
Increases melee damage to a minor degree, Speed and wait_time
Speed is determined by a log of your dexterity.
wait_time is how long you wait after activating an ability for it to do something. This allows for indicators. 
If you don't slack on your dex it's roughly half of your cooldown
Power
Increases ranged damage to a major degree, increases your max Qi, and increases your technique_size
Max qi is what it says on the tin, how much Qi you have, take care to invest in this at least slightly or you won't be able to cast spells, or sustain spell barrages.
technique_size, is a mix of range and size. For non area spells it is just range, for area projectiles it is both range and size. For area spells it is just size.
technique_size scales multiplicatively.
Control
Increases ranged damage to a minor degree, increases Qi Regeneration, and decreases cooldown.
Qi Regeneration is equal non withstanding any buffs, debuffs, or alterations to your control*9 and its how much qi you regenerate each second. 
While most of the time qi regeneration can stay on top of your costs, due to regeneration and cooldown being tied together, having a high dexterity or using costly spells can overwhelm it
Take care, due to the fact that you can stack uses of spells, even toggling a spell off will quickly result in you blowing most of your reserves if you aren't careful.
Cooldown is lowered logarithmically by control while also being altered by cooldown of the spell. Control is more effective the higher the original cooldown was
Defense
Reduces incoming damage by a flat amount, and reduces cost.
Due to pierce, defense must be adequetly kept up, or your defensive capabilities will fall below your opponents pierce and you will take far more damage than you should
Defense reduces cost in a logarithmic manner, and its effectiveness scales with the stat_dist size. Higher cost results in defense taking away more cost. Increasing every stage."
